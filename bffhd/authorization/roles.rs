/// A "Role" from the Authorization perspective
///
/// You can think of a role as a bundle of permissions relating to other roles. In most cases a
/// role represents a real-world education or apprenticeship, which gives a person the education
/// necessary to use a machine safely.
/// Roles are assigned permissions which in most cases evaluate to granting a person the right to
/// use certain (potentially) dangerous machines.
/// Using this indirection makes administration easier in certain ways; instead of maintaining
/// permissions on users directly the user is given a role after having been educated on the safety
/// of a machine; if later on a similar enough machine is put to use the administrator can just add
/// the permission for that machine to an already existing role instead of manually having to
/// assign to all users.
