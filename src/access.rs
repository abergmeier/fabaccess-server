/// use certain (potentially) dangerous machines.

/// permissions on users directly the user is given a role after having been educated on the safety
/// of a machine; if later on a similar enough machine is put to use the administrator can just add
/// the permission for that machine to an already existing role instead of manually having to
/// assign to all users.
